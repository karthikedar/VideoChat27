# VideoChat27 
This is a basic Video Chat app with one on one video chat feature.

I have used Nodejs for backend and ReactJs for frontend. Along with this I have used Simple-peer from WebRTC for peer to peer communication.

The Demo for this is deployed at https://kdvideochat.netlify.app/

Some of the basic features are:-
- Call Your Friend using Call button by Entering your name and your Friend's id.
- Mute and Disable Video Options.
- The Video Button on the top beside the Heading, takes the user to the part of the web where he/she can start a call or end a call, rather than scrolling to this part.
- The user receives an alert if he/she tries to call without entering name or id.
